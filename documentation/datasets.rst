Generally, the detailed setup procedure for each dataset can be found at its official document.
In this section, we still provide a simple guidance about how to setup each dataset in a step by step way,
saving the time for redirecting to new sites and read the comprehensive guidance.

The content of each subsection is a simplified version based on the official setup procedures of each dataset.
Thus if you encountered some problems with our simplified setup instructions,
please read related official documentation.

**Also, we kindly ask you to report the encountered problem when following our procedures.
We will fix it as best as we can and record it in the troubleshooting section for each dataset.** |:blush:|
